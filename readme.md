# Visualisation app for the Biological Health Score project 

This is part of an ongoing health research work that is undertaken by the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Imperial College, London UK.

Currently, the upstream analysis pipeline is already using `Ploomber`. This lives in [another repository](https://github.com/dcstang/tromso-delta-bhs). The study population from the UK Biobank Project is analysed via various population selection criteria and regression models. 

This is an outshoot from the project for the Ploomber<>Panel Hackaton. I aim to democratise access and understanding of the `health scores` that are being developed within the group, firstly to other scientists in the department -- for further colaboration and ideation. Eventually, I think this could be a useful tool for (rigorous) scientific peer review before actual use in the clinical setting.

As a bit of background, I was initially working on visualisations in Dash/Plotly. But I'll now migrate the work to Panel in view of ease of deployment.
